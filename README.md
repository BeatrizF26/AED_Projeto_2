# AED Project 2
This project focuses on developing ***algorithms for directed graphs*** without edge weights.

## Requirements:
- Create a function that constructs the transposed graph, reversing the direction of all edges.
- Implement a function to compute the shortes path tree from a given stating vertex to all reachabel vertices in a graph.
- Develop a function to construct the transitive closure of a directed graph.
- Implement a feature to calculate the shortest distances between all pairs of vertices.
